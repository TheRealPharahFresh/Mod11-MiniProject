Description: In this code, I’ve created a React app that handles customer, product, and order management. I imported several components like `CustomerDetails`, `ProductDetails`, and `OrderDetails`, as well as forms to add or edit customers, products, and orders. I used `react-router-dom` to define different routes, which determine what components are shown for each URL path (e.g., customer list, product details, or order details). I’ve also included a `NavigationBar` for navigation between pages, and a wildcard route (`*`) to catch any undefined paths and show a "Not Found" page. Bootstrap is used for styling the app.
